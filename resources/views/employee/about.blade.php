    <h3>About HRMS</h3>
    <p>In the HRMS, the employee dashboard provides a clear overview of department-related information such as the
         department name, the HR assigned to it, and the total number of employees within that department. 
        Employees can apply for leave directly from the dashboard by selecting the leave dates and specifying 
        the reason. Once submitted, leave applications are forwarded to the HR for approval, and the employee can
         track the statusâ€”whether it is approved, pending, or rejected. The system also includes a leave status 
         section where all past and current requests are listed. Additionally, employees can view their profile 
         containing personal details like name, email, and department, and update basic information if allowed.</p>
